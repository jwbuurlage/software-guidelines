# Computational Imaging Software Guides

In this repository we host two guides for the development and distribution of
software projects of the CI group of CWI: the _software release guide_ for
releasing and maintaining open-source software alongside your research, and a
general _how-to_ guide that covers many different topics for software
development.

## Guides
### Software release guide

The _CICWI Software Release Guide_ can be viewed
[online](https://cicwi.github.io/software-guides/software-release-guide), as
a
[pdf](https://github.com/cicwi/software-guides/raw/master/docs/software-release-guide.pdf),
or you can look at the
[`org`](https://github.com/cicwi/software-guides/raw/master/software-release-guide.org)
source.

It is a step-by-step guide for converting an arbitrary software project into a
package that is usable, installable, and understandable by others. We do not
only discuss the _hows_, but also the _whys_ of distributing scientific
software.

### How-to guide

The _CICWI How-to Software Guide_ can be viewed
[online](https://cicwi.github.io/software-guides/how-to-guide), as a
[pdf](https://github.com/cicwi/software-guides/raw/master/docs/how-to-guide.pdf),
or you can look at the
[`org`](https://github.com/cicwi/software-guides/raw/master/how-to-guide.org)
source.

This (living) document is a collection of small, self-contained tutorials to
accomplish specific tasks that have to do with software development.
